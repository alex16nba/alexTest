- [ ] Add Delete button to listview
- [ ] Add Edit button to listview
- [ ] Add Pick button to listview
- [ ] Add Pick Winner Form
- [ ] Implement some sort of Authentication
- [ ] Update the application style

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [git](http://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine.
2. Clone this into your local machine using the terminal (mac) or Gitbash (PC) `> git clone https://github.com/planetoftheweb/attendance.git`
3. CD to the folder `cd attendance`
4. Run `> npm-install` to install the project dependencies
5. Run the Gulp command `> gulp`
6. Fire up your browser at `http://localhost:8080`


## No images
Remember, this example doesn't include the images folder or the images from the course. For those you have to be a premium member of lynda.com and have access to the exercise files. Use your own images or replace the images with a site like [PlaceHold.it](http://placehold.it/)
